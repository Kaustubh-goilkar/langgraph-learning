# 🧠 LangGraph Complete Learning Guide
### Building Reliable Agentic Systems with Structured AI Workflows

LangGraph is a framework designed to build **stateful, controllable, and production-ready AI agents**.  
Unlike traditional LLM chatbots, LangGraph enables developers to create **deterministic workflows, persistent memory, conditional logic, and fault-tolerant execution**.

This repository acts as a **complete technical reference and learning guide for LangGraph**.

# 1️⃣ What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a **workflow orchestration framework for AI agents** built on top of LangChain.

It allows developers to create **graph-based agent workflows** where:

- Nodes perform tasks
- Edges control execution flow
- State persists across steps
- Execution is deterministic and traceable

Think of it like:

React → UI State Management  
LangGraph → AI Agent State Management

---

# 2️⃣ Why LangGraph Exists

Traditional LLM systems suffer from several problems:

❌ Stateless conversations  
❌ No workflow control  
❌ Hard to debug  
❌ No recovery if the system fails  
❌ No human approval layer  

LangGraph introduces:

✅ Persistent state  
✅ Graph-based workflow orchestration  
✅ Conditional routing  
✅ Checkpointing  
✅ Parallel execution  
✅ Human-in-the-loop systems  

---

# 🏗️ 3️⃣ Core Architecture

| Component | Technical Definition | Industry Analogy |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Graph | Workflow structure controlling execution | Assembly line |
| Nodes | Python functions performing tasks | Workstations |
| Edges | Define transitions between nodes | Conveyor belts |
| State | Shared data schema across workflow | Work order |
| Reducers | Rules for updating state | Ledger |

---

# 4️⃣ State Management

State is the **shared data structure passed between nodes**.

Example:

```python
from typing import TypedDict

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    user_query: str
    messages: list
    result: str
```

Every node receives the **current state** and returns updates.

---

# 5️⃣ Reducers

Reducers control **how state updates happen**.

Example:

```python
from typing import Annotated
import operator

messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]
```

This tells LangGraph:

Append new messages to the existing list.

---

# ⚙️ 6️⃣ Execution Model (Pregel Inspired)

LangGraph is inspired by **Google's Pregel distributed graph processing system**.

Execution works in **steps**.

Step 1 → Node executes  
Step 2 → State updated  
Step 3 → Next nodes triggered  

Benefits:

- Fault tolerance
- Crash recovery
- Time travel debugging

---

# 7️⃣ Nodes

Nodes are **Python functions that operate on state**.

Example:

```python
def search_node(state):

    query = state["user_query"]

    result = f"Searching web for {query}"

    return {
        "result": result
    }
```

---

# 8️⃣ Edges and Conditional Routing

Edges determine **which node runs next**.

Fixed Edge Example:

```python
workflow.add_edge("search", "summarize")
```

Conditional Example:

```python
def router(state):

    if state["authorized"]:
        return "approved"

    return "rejected"
```

---

# 9️⃣ Parallel Execution

Multiple nodes can run simultaneously.

Example workflow:

User Query  
 ├── Search Web  
 └── Search Database  

Reducers merge the outputs.

---

# 🔟 Checkpointing and Persistence

LangGraph supports **persistent state storage**.

Example:

```python
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory_saver)
```

Storage backends:

- Redis
- Postgres
- SQLite

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ Human-in-the-loop

Critical workflows require **human approval**.

Example:

Refund Request  
      ↓  
AI Decision  

Amount < $50 → Auto Refund  

Amount > $50 → Human Approval → Execute Refund

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ Tools and External APIs

Agents often call external systems.

Examples:

- Search APIs
- Databases
- Payment APIs
- Internal services

Example:

```python
def call_payment_api(state):

    amount = state["refund_amount"]

    process_payment(amount)

    return {"status": "completed"}
```

---

# 💼 1️⃣3️⃣ Industry Example — Autonomous Refund Agent

Workflow:

User Complaint  
      ↓  
Triage Node  

Check Refund Amount  

Refund < $50 → Auto Approve  

Refund > $50 → Human Approval  

Process Refund

---

# 🛠️ 1️⃣4️⃣ Code Implementation Example

```python
from typing import Annotated, TypedDict
import operator
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

class AgentState(TypedDict):

    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    is_authorized: bool


def call_model(state: AgentState):

    return {
        "messages": ["AI: Checking your records..."]
    }


workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)

workflow.set_entry_point("agent")

workflow.add_edge("agent", END)

app = workflow.compile()
```

---

- Databases
- APIs

---

# 🔍 1️⃣6️⃣ Debugging and Observability

Recommended tool:

LangSmith

Tracks:

- Node execution
- State transitions
- Latency
- Errors

---

# 🧠 1️⃣7️⃣ Best Practices

Keep nodes small  
Each node should perform a single task.

Keep state minimal  
Avoid large state objects.

Use reducers carefully  
Reducers prevent state corruption.

Use human approval for critical actions.

Enable checkpointing in production.

Exercise 1

Create workflow:

User Question  
      ↓  
Search Node  
      ↓  
Summarize Node  

Exercise 2

Add conditional routing:

If question contains "math"

→ calculator node

Else

→ LLM node

Exercise 3

Add parallel nodes:

Query  
 ├── web search  
 └── database search  

Merge results.

Exercise 4

Add a human approval node before executing an API.
